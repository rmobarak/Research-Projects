# Research-Projects
This folder contains all code and materials for three notable independent projects within my time at Macalester College. My final paper for Introduction to Econometrics, my senior research capstone for International Economic Development and a Stata visualization guide for my Teaching Assistantship for Introduction to Econometrics.

All components within each project such as tables,figures, coding files have been saved in subfolders within the main project folder. For the two research projects, the written papers have been saved in the "Final Paper" folder.

To run the Stata dofile download all subfolders for the specific project within a single folder in the system. Then change the working directory line of the dofile to specify to the folder.
