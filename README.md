# Research-Projects
This folder contains all code and materials for three notable independent projects within my time at Macalester College. My final paper for Introduction to Econometrics, my senior research capstone for International Economic Development and a Stata visualization guide for my Teaching Assistantship for Introduction to Econometrics.

All components within each project such as tables, figures, coding files and data have been saved in subfolders within the main project folder. For the two research projects, the written papers have been saved in the "Paper" folder.

To run the Stata dofile download the folders as a Zip file from here. Then unzip and extract the folder for a specific project. The do-file is located in the "Codes" folder. Finally, change the working directory line of the dofile to specify to the location of where the folder is saved within the system.
